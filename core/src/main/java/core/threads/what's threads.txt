thread          =   A thread of execution in a program (kind of like a virtual GPU)
                    The JVM allows an application to have multiples threads running concurrently
                    Each thread can execute parts of your code in parallel with the main thread
                    Each thread has a priority
                    Threads with higher priority are executed in preference compared to threads with lower priority

                    The Java Virtual Machine continues to execute thread until either of the following occurs
                        1. The exit method of class Runtime has been called
                        2. All the user threads have died

                    When a JVM starts up there is a thread which calls the main method
                    This thread is called "main"

                    Daemon thread is a low priority thread that runs in background to perform tasks such as
                    garbage collection
                    JVM terminates itself when all user threads (non-daemon threads) finish their execution

multithreading  =   Process of executing multiple threads simultaneously
                    Helps maximum utilization of CPU
                    Threads are independent, they don't affect the execution of other threads.
                    An exception in one thread will not interrupt other threads
                    useful for serving multiple clients, multiplayer games, or other mutually independent tasks
